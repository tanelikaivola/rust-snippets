# Introduction

This book aims to speed up development by helping the developer add some (basic, but useful) functionality to Rust projects easily.

The idea is to provide something that can be mostly copy pasted and provide links to additional resource links to highly relevant references and tutorials.

Currently this lives in: [GitHub](https://github.com/tanelikaivola/rust-snippets). Pull requests are welcome!

By magic of continous integration, static pages are built to [GitHub Pages](https://tanelikaivola.github.io/rust-snippets/) - You might be here already!
